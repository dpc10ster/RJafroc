<meta property="og:description" content="RJafroc implements software for assessing medical imaging systems, radiologists or computer aided detection algorithms. Models of   observer performance are implemented, including the binormal model (BM), the contaminated binormal model (CBM), the correlated   contaminated binormal model (CORCBM), and the radiological search model (RSM). The software and applications are described in a book - Chakraborty DP: Observer Performance Methods for Diagnostic Imaging - Foundations, Modeling, and Applications with R-Based Examples. Taylor-Francis LLC; 2017 and its Online Appendices https://github.com/dpc10ster/onlinebookk21778. Observer performance data collection paradigms are the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and its location specific extensions, primarily free-response ROC (FROC) and the location ROC (LROC). ROC data consists of single ratings per images.A rating is the perceived confidence level that the image is that of a diseased patient. FROC data consists of a variable number  (including zero) of mark-rating pairs per image, where a mark is the location of a clinically reportable suspicious region and   the rating is the corresponding confidence level that it is a true lesion. LROC data consists of a rating and a forced localizati on of the most suspicious region on every image. RJafroc supersedes the deprecated Windows version of JAFROC software V4.2.1, http://www.devchakraborty.com. Package functions are organized as follows. Data file related function names are preceded by Df, curve fitting functions by Fit, included data sets by dataset, plotting functions by Plot, significance testing functions by St, sample size related functions by Ss, data simulation functions by Simulate and utility functions by Util.Implemented are a number of figures of merit (FOMs) for quantifying performance, functions for visualizing empirical operating characteristics: e.g., ROC, FROC, alternative FROC (AFROC) and weighted AFROC (wAFROC) curves. Four maximum likelihood curve-fitting algorithms are implemented: the binormal model (BM), the contaminated binormal model (CBM), the correlated contaminated binormal model (CORCBM) and the radiological search model (RSM). Unlike the binormal model, CBM, CORCBM and RSM predict &quot;proper&quot; ROC curves that do not cross the chance diagonal or display inappropriate &quot;hooks&quot;, typically near the upper right corner of the plots. RSM fitting additionally yields measures of search and lesion-classification performances. Search performance is the ability to find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions. Lesion-classification performance is the ability to correctly classify found lesions from found non-lesions. For fully crossed study designs significance testing of reader-averaged FOM differences between modalities is implemented via both Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz and the Obuchowski-Rockette methods, both substantially improved by Hillis. Also implemented are single treatment analyses, which allow comparison of performance of a group of radiologists to a specified value, or comparison to CAD to a group of radiologists interpreting the same cases. Crossed-modality analysis is implemented wherein there are two crossed treatment factors and the desire is to determined performance in each treatment factor averaged over all levels of the other factor. Sample size estimation tools are provided for ROC and FROC studies; these use estimates of the relevant variances from a pilot study to predict required numbers of readers and cases in a pivotal study to achieve a desired power. Utility and data file manipulation functions allow data to be read in any of the currently used input formats, including Excel, and the results of the analysis can be viewed in text or Excel output files. The methods are illustrated with several included datasets from the author's international collaborations. The package is used extensively in the cited book." />

       but which depends on the RSM \(\mu\) parameter</p></li>
<li><p>Proximity criterion / acceptance radius: Used in connection with FROC 
       (or LROC data); the "nearness" criterion is used to determine if a mark 
       is close enough to a lesion to be counted as a LL (or correct localization); 
       otherwise it is counted as a NL (or incorrect localization)</p></li>
<li><p>p-value: the probability, under the null hypothesis, that the observed

    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="dataset"><a class="anchor" href="#dataset"></a>Dataset</h2>

    <p>An R object either created by the user or read from an external text or 
     Excel file. It is a <code>list</code> generally containing 8 members (9 members 
     for crossed-modality or LROC datasets): <strong>Note: <code>-Inf</code> is used to 
     indicate the ratings of unmarked lesions and/or to indicate missing array 
     items. An example of the latter would be if the maximum number of NLs in a 
     dataset was 4, but some images had fewer than 4 NLs, in which case the corresponding 
     "empty" positions would be filled with <code>-Inf</code>s. Do not use <code>NA</code> to 
     denote a rating.</strong></p>  
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <b>"dataset" in this package always represents an 
     <code>R</code> object with one of the following structures:</b></p><h3>General data structure, example <code>dataset02</code> and <code>dataset05</code></h3>
    <ul>
<li><p><code>NL</code>: a floating-point array with dimension  
             <code><a href='https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/c'>c(I, J, K, maxNL)</a></code> containing the ratings of NL marks. The first 
             K1 locations of the third index corresponds to NL marks on non-diseased 
             cases and the remaining locations correspond to NL marks on diseased 
             cases. The 4th dimension allows for the possibility of multiple NL marks 
             on a case. For <b>FROC</b> datasets unavailable or missing NL ratings are assigned 
             <code>-Inf</code>. For <b>ROC</b> datasets FP ratings are assigned to the first 
             <code>K1</code> elements of <code>NL[,,1:K1,1]</code> and the remaining <code>K2</code> 
             elements of <code>NL[,,(K1+1):K,1]</code> are set to <code>-Inf</code>. When 
             converting from FROC to ROC data the software assigns <code>-Inf</code> 
             to cases with no marks.</p></li>
<li><p><code>LL</code>: a floating-point array with dimension  
             <code><a href='https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/c'>c(I, J, K2, maxLL)</a></code> that contains the ratings of all LL marks. 
             For ROC datasets <code>TP</code> ratings are assigned to <code>LL[,,1:K2,1]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>lesionVector</code>: a integer vector with length <code>K2</code>, whose 
             elements indicate the number of lesions in each diseased case.</p></li>
<li><p><code>lesionID</code>: an integer array with dimension [K2, maxLL]. 
             Its contents label lesions on diseased cases. For example,  
             <code>dataset05$lesionID[40,]</code> is <code><a href='https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/c'>c(1,2,-Inf)</a></code>, meaning the 
             40th diseased case in this dataset has two lesions, labeled 1 and 2. 
             The <code>lesionID</code> of an LL in the <samp>TP</samp> or <samp>LL</samp> worksheet 
             must correspond to the <code>lesionID</code> for that case in the 
             <samp>Truth</samp> worksheet. For example, if the <code>lesionID</code> for the 
             40th diseased case in the <samp>TP</samp> or <samp>LL</samp> worksheet is 2, 
             then the associated rating must correspond to the lesion labeled 2 
             in the <samp>Truth</samp> worksheet, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>lesionWeight</code>: a floating point array with dimension 
             <code><a href='https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/c'>c(K2, maxLL)</a></code>, representing the relative importance of detecting 
             each lesion. For each case, the weights sum to unity. If zero is assigned 
             to the <code>Weight</code> field in the <samp>Truth</samp> worksheet,  the 
             software automatically assigns equal weighting, e.g., 
             <code>dataset05$lesionWeight[40,]</code> is <code><a href='https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/c'>c(0.5,0.5)</a></code>, corresponding to 
             equal weights (1/2) to each lesion on an image with two lesions.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dataType</code>: a <code>character</code> variable: "<code>ROC</code>", "<code>LROC</code>", "<code>ROI</code>" or "<code>FROC</code>".</p></li>
<li><p><code>modalityID</code>: a <code>character</code> vector of length \(I\), which labels the 
             modalities in the dataset.</p></li>
<li><p><code>readerID</code>: a <code>character</code> vector of length \(J\), which labels the 
             readers. For example, <code>NL[1, 2, , ]</code> indicates the NL-rating of the 
             reader identified with the second label in <code>readerID</code> using the 
             modality identified with the first label in <code>modalityID</code>.</p></li>

             that contains the ratings of Q quadrants for each non-diseased case (k &lt;= K1). 
             For k &gt; K1,  
             elements contain valid ratings while the rest are filled with <code>-Inf</code>s.</p></li>
<li><p><code>LL</code>: a floating-point array with dimension  
             <code><a href='https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/c'>c(I, J, K2, 1)</a></code> that contains the ratings of all <em>correct</em> 
             localization (CL) marks. A <code>-Inf</code> indicates a case with no CL mark.</p></li>
<li><p><code>LLIl</code>: a floating-point array with dimension  
             <code><a href='https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/c'>c(I, J, K2, 1)</a></code> that contains the ratings of all <em>incorrect</em>

    <p></p><h3>Data file format</h3>
    The package reads JAFROC, MRMC (ROC data only) and iMRMC (ROC data only) 
       data files. The data can be imported by using the function 
       <a href='DfReadDataFile.html'>DfReadDataFile</a>.
    <ul>
<li><p><strong>JAFROC data file format</strong>
      The JAFROC data file is an Excel file containing three worksheets (*.xls and 
         *.xlsx are supported): (1) the <samp>Truth</samp> worksheet, (2) the <samp>TP</samp> 
         or <samp>LL</samp> worksheet and (3) the <samp>FP</samp> or <samp>NL</samp> worksheet. 
         Except for the <samp>Truth</samp> worksheet, where each case must occur at least 
         once, the number of rows in the other worksheets is variable.
      <ol>
<li><p><samp>Truth</samp> worksheet consists of</p><ul>
<li><p><samp>CaseID</samp>, an integer field uniquely labeling the cases 
                   (images). It must occur at least once for each case, and since a 
                   case may have multiple lesions, it can occur multiple times, 
                   once for each lesion.</p></li>
<li><p><samp>LesionID</samp>, an integer field uniquely labeling the lesions 
                   in each case. This field is zero for non-diseased cases.</p></li>
<li><p><samp>Weight</samp>, a floating-point field, which is the relative 
                   importance of detecting each lesion. This field is zero for 
                   non-diseased cases and for equally weighted lesions; otherwise 
                   the weights must sum to unity for each case. Unless a weighted 
                   figure of merit is selected, this field is irrelevant.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><samp>TP</samp> worksheet consists of</p><ul>
<li><p><samp>ReaderID</samp>, a <code>character</code> field uniquely labeling the readers 
                     (radiologists).</p></li>
<li><p><samp>ModalityID</samp>, a <code>character</code> field uniquely labeling the 
                     modalities.</p></li>
<li><p><samp>CaseID</samp>, see <samp>Truth</samp> worksheet. A non-diseased 
                     case in this field will generate an error.</p></li>
<li><p><samp>LesionID</samp>, see <samp>Truth</samp> worksheet. An entry in this 
                     field that does not appear in the <samp>Truth</samp> worksheet will 
                     generate an error. It is the user's responsibility to ensure 
                     that the entries in the <samp>Truth</samp> and <samp>TP</samp> worksheets 
                     correspond to the same physical lesions.</p></li>
<li><p><samp>TP_Rating</samp>, a positive floating-point field denoting the 
                     rating assigned to a particular lesion-localization mark, with 
                     higher numbers represent greater confidence that the location 
                     is actually a lesion.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><samp>FP</samp> worksheet consists of</p><ul>
<li><p><samp>ReaderID</samp>, see <samp>TP</samp> worksheet.</p></li>
<li><p><samp>ModalityID</samp>, see <samp>TP</samp> worksheet.</p></li>
<li><p><samp>CaseID</samp>, see <samp>TP</samp> worksheet.</p></li>
<li><p><samp>FP_Rating</samp>, a positive floating-point field denoting the 
                     rating assigned to a particular non-lesion-localization mark, 
                     with higher numbers represent greater confidence that the location 
                     is actually a lesion.</p></li>

<li><p>The fourth line must have the letter (l or s) or word (large or 
                 small) for each modality. The letter or word indicates that smaller 
                 or larger ratings represent stronger confidence of presence of disease.</p></li>
<li><p>The following lines contain the ratings in all modalities, 
                 separated by spaces or tabs, of the non-diseased cases, one case per 
                 line. The cases must appear in the same order for all readers. 
                 Missing value is not allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>After the last non-diseased case insert a line containing the 
                 asterisk (*) symbol.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the diseased cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 2, 5, 6 and 7 for the remaining readers.</p></li>
