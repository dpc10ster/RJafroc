c	For FORMAT B, the inputted data must be structured as follows:
c
c	{The next J lines give the J x I matrix of estimated accuracies
c	where J is the number of rows, aka readers, and I is the number
c	of columns, aka diagnostic tests.  Note that these estimated
c	accuracies (or a suitable transformation of them) should take on 
c	values between zero and one.}
c	The fixed format for these data must be specified by the user in
c	the main body of the program.
c		estimated accuracy for reader 1 for each of I tests
c		estimated accuracy for reader 2 for each of I tests
c		etc.
c		estimated accuracy for reader J for each of I tests
c
c	{The next J lines give the J x J matrix of estimated 
c	variances and covariances corresponding to modality 1.  So, the first
c	entry is the variance of the estimated accuracy of reader 1 in 
c	modality 1.  The second entry in that same row is the covariance of
c	the estimated accuracies of readers 1 and 2 for modality 1.  etc.  
c	In the J-th row, the first entry is the covariance of the estimated
c	accuracies of readers 1 and J for modality 1.} 
c		estimated variance and covariances for reader 1 in test 1
c		estimated variance and covariances for reader 2 in test 1
c		etc.
c		estimated variances and covariances for reader J in test 1
c
c	{The next J lines give the J x J matrix of estimated 
c	variances and covariances corresponding to modality 2.  So, the first
c	entry is the variance of the estimated accuracy of reader 1 in 
c	modality 2.  The second entry in that same row is the covariance of
c	the estimated accuracies of readers 1 and 2 for modality 2.  etc.  
c	In the J-th row, the first entry is the covariance of the estimated
c	accuracies of readers 1 and J for modality 2.} 
c		estimated variance and covariances for reader 1 in test 2
c		estimated variance and covariances for reader 2 in test 2
c		etc.
c		estimated variances and covariances for reader J in test 2
c
c	{The next J lines give the J x J matrix of covariances
c	corresponding to having a reader in modality 1 and a reader in
c	modality 2.   So, the first entry is the covariance between
c	the estimated accuracies of reader 1 in modality 1 and reader 1 in
c	modality 2.  The second entry in that same row is the covariance of
c	the estimated accuracies of reader 1 in modality 1 and reader 2 in
c	modality 2, etc.  
c	In the J-th row, the first entry is the covariance of the estimated
c	accuracies of reader J in modality 1 and reader 1 in modality 2.} 
c		cov for reader 1 in modality 1 with other readers in modality 2.
