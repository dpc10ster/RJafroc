Description: Tools for quantitative assessment of medical imaging systems, radiologists or computer aided detection ('CAD') algorithms. 
    Implements methods described in the book: 'Chakraborty' (2017) <ISBN:978-1482214840>. Data collection paradigms include receiver 
    operating characteristic ('ROC') and a location specific extension, namely free-response 'ROC' ('FROC'). 'ROC' data consists of a 
    single rating per image, where the rating is the perceived confidence level the image is of a diseased patient. 'FROC' data consists 
    of a variable number (including zero) of mark-rating pairs per image, where a mark is the location of a clinically relevant suspicious 
    region and the rating is the corresponding confidence level that it is a true lesion. The name 'RJafroc' is derived from it being an 
    enhanced R version of original Windows 'JAFROC' <http://www.devchakraborty.com>. Implemented are a number of figures of merit quantifying
    performance, functions for visualizing operating characteristics and three ROC ratings data curve-fitting algorithms: the 'binormal' 
    model ('BM'), the contaminated 'binormal' model ('CBM') and the 'radiological' search model ('RSM') 'Chakraborty' (2006) <{doi:10.1088/0031-9155/51/14/012}> . 
    Also implemented is maximum likelihood fitting of paired ROC data, utilizing the correlated 'CBM' model ('CORCBM') model. Unlike the 'BM', which predicts 'improper' ROC curves, 'CBM', 'CORCBM' and the 'RSM' predict proper ROC curves 
    that do not cross the chance diagonal. 'RSM' fitting additionally yields measures of search and lesion-classification performances, in addition 
    to the usual case-classification performance measured by the area under the 'ROC' curve. Search performance is the ability to find lesions while avoiding 
    finding non-lesions. Lesion-classification performance is the ability to discriminate between found lesions and non-lesions. For fully crossed study 
    designs, termed multiple-reader multiple-case, significance testing of reader-averaged figure-of-merit differences between 'modalities' is implemented 
    via both 'pseudovalue'-based and 'FOM'-based methods. Single treatment analysis allows comparison of performance of a group of radiologists to a 
    specified value, or comparison of 'CAD' performance to a group of radiologists interpreting the same cases. Sample size estimation tools are provided 
    for 'ROC' and 'FROC' studies that allow estimation of relevant variances from a pilot study, in order to predict required numbers of readers and cases in 
    a pivotal study. Utility and data file manipulation functions allow data to be read in any of the currently used input formats, including Excel, and the 
    results of the analysis can be viewed in text or Excel output files.
