Description: Tools for quantitative assessment of medical imaging systems, radiologists or computer aided ('CAD') algorithms. 
    Implements methods described in a book: 'Chakraborty' 'DP' (2017), "Observer Performance Methods for Diagnostic Imaging - 
    Foundations, Modeling, and Applications with R-Based Examples", Taylor-Francis 
    and its Online Appendices <https://github.com/dpc10ster/onlinebookk21778>. Data collection paradigms include receiver 
    operating characteristic ('ROC') and a location specific extension, namely free-response 'ROC' ('FROC'). 
    'ROC' data consists of a single rating per image, where the rating is the perceived confidence level the image is of a 
    diseased patient. 'FROC' data consists of a variable number (including zero) of mark-rating pairs per image, where a mark 
    is the location of a clinically reportable suspicious region and the rating is the corresponding confidence level that it 
    is a true lesion. The software supersedes the current Windows version of 'JAFROC' software <http://www.devchakraborty.com> 
    which is no longer supported. 'RJafroc' is derived from it being an enhanced R version of original Windows 'JAFROC'. 
    Implemented are a number of figures of merit quantifying performance, functions for visualizing operating characteristics; 
    three ROC ratings data curve-fitting algorithms: the 'binormal' model ('BM'), the contaminated 'binormal' model ('CBM') and 
    the radiological search model ('RSM'). Also implemented is maximum likelihood fitting of paired ROC data, utilizing the 
    correlated 'CBM' model ('CORCBM') model. Unlike the 'BM' which predicts 'improper' ROC curves, 'CBM', 'CORCBM'  and the 'RSM' 
    predict proper ROC curves that do not cross the chance diagonal or display inappropriate hooks, usually near the upper right 
    corner of the plots. 'RSM' fitting yields measures of search and lesion-classification performances, in addition to the usual 
    case-classification performance measured by the area under the 'ROC' curve. Search performance is the ability to find lesions 
    while avoiding finding non-lesions. Lesion-classification performance is the ability to discriminate between found lesions 
    and non-lesions. For fully crossed study designs, termed multiple-reader multiple-case, significance testing of reader-averaged 
    figure-of-merit differences between modalities is implemented via both 'Dorfman', 'Berbaum' and 'Metz' ('DBM') and the 
    'Obuchowski' and 'Rockette' ('OR') methods, both substantially improved by 'Hillis'. Single treatment analysis allows 
    comparison of performance of a group of radiologists to a specified value, or comparison of 'CAD' performance to a group 
    of radiologists interpreting the same cases. Sample size estimation tools are provided for 'ROC' and 'FROC' studies that 
    allow estimation of relevant variances from a pilot study to predict required numbers of readers and cases in a pivotal study. 
    Utility and data file manipulation functions allow data to be read in any of the currently used input formats, including Excel, 
    and the results of the analysis can be viewed in text or Excel output files.
