## Introduction
* This vignette explains the data format of the input Excel file for an **ROC SPLIT-PLOT-A** dataset.
* The **A** refers to Table VII, part (a), in [@RN2508].
* In a SPLIT-PLOT-A dataset two distinct groups of readers interpret all cases in two modalities.
* The vignette is illustrated with a toy data file, `inst/extdata/toyFiles/ROC/rocSpA.xlsx` in which readers 1 and 2 interpret 10 cases in the first modality and readers 3 and 4 interpret the same cases in the second modality.
* The Excel file has three worksheets named `Truth`, `NL` (or `FP`) and `LL` (or `TP`).

## The `Truth` worksheet 
* The `Truth` worksheet contains 6 columns: `CaseID`, `LesionID`, `Weight`, `ReaderID`, `ModalityID` and `Paradigm`. 
* The first five columns contain *twice* as many rows as there are distinct cases in the dataset. The factor of two is coming from the two modalities.
* The normal cases are numbered 6,7,8,9,10; the abnormal cases are numbered 16,17,18,19,20; i.e., `K1` = `K2` = 5 and `K` = 10. The number of rows of data is 2 * K = 20.
* The `ReaderID` field for the first modality has *two values* `1, 2` since readers 1 and 2 interpret all cases in the first modality. The corresponding values for the second modality are '3, 4',
* `ModalityID`: The first modality is labeled `4` aand the second is '2' . [`ReaderID`, the `ModalityID` are *text formatted labels*.] 
* `Paradigm`: The contents of this field are `ROC` and `SPLIT-PLOT-A` (case insensitive). 

## The structure of the ROC split-plot-A dataset
This code-chunk reads the data into a split plot dataset: 

```{r}
rocSpA <- system.file("extdata", "toyFiles/ROC/rocSpA.xlsx",
                        package = "RJafroc", mustWork = TRUE)
x <- DfReadDataFile(rocSpA, newExcelFileFormat = TRUE)
str(x)
```             

* Flag `newExcelFileFormat` **must** be set to `TRUE` to the read split plot dataset. 
* The dataset object `x` is a `list` variable with 3 members: `x$ratings`, `x$lesions` and `x$descriptions`.
* There are `K2 = 5` diseased cases (the length of the third dimension of `ratings$LL`) and `K1 = 5` non-diseased cases (the length of the third dimension of `ratings$NL` minus `K2`). 
* `x$ratings$NL`, a [2, 4, 10, 1] array, contains the ratings of normal cases. 
* `x$ratings$LL`, a [2, 5, 5, 1] array, contains the ratings of abnormal cases.
* The `dataType` member is `r x$dataType` which specifies the data collection method, `"ROC"` in this example. 
* The `x$modalityID` member is a vector with two elements `"4"` and `"2"`, naming the two modalities. 
* The `x$readerID` member is a vector with four elements `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`, `"4", labeling the four readers. 
* The `x$design` member is `r x$design`; specifies the dataset design, "SPLIT-PLOT-A" for this example. 
* The `x$descriptions$truthTableStr` member quantifies the structure of the dataset, as explained next.

## The truthTableStr member 
* This is a `2 x 4 x 10 x 2` array, i.e., `I` x `J` x `K` x (maximum number of lesions per case plus 1). The `plus 1 ` is needed to accommodate normal cases. 
* Each entry in this array is either `1`, meaning the corresponding interpretation exists, or `NA`,  meaning the corresponding interpretation does not exist. 
* The first reader interprets the normal cases in the first modality only: 

```{r}
x$descriptions$truthTableStr[,1,1:10,1]
```             

* The first reader interprets the abnormal cases also in the first modality only: 

```{r}
x$descriptions$truthTableStr[,1,1:10,2]
```             

* Likewise for the second reader: 

```{r}
x$descriptions$truthTableStr[,2,1:10,1]
x$descriptions$truthTableStr[,2,1:10,2]
```             

* The third reader interprets the cases in the second modality only: 

```{r}
x$descriptions$truthTableStr[,3,1:10,1]
x$descriptions$truthTableStr[,3,1:10,2]
```             

* Likewise for the fourth reader: 

```{r}
x$descriptions$truthTableStr[,4,1:10,1]
x$descriptions$truthTableStr[,4,1:10,2]
```             

## The false positive (FP) ratings
These are found in the `FP` or `NL` worksheet:

![](images/rocSpAFp.png){width=100%}

* The common vertical length is 20 in this example (1 modality times 4 readers times 5 non-diseased cases). 
* `ReaderID`: the reader labels: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, as declared in the `Truth` worksheet. 
* `ModalityID`: `4` or `2`, as declared in the `Truth` worksheet. 
* `CaseID`: `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, or `10`, as declared in the `Truth` worksheet  
* `NL_Rating`: the ratings of non-diseased cases.


```{r}
x$ratings$NL[,1,1:10,1]
```             


## The true positive (TP) ratings
These are found in the `TP` or `LL` worksheet, see below.

![](images/rocSpATp.png){width=100%}

* This worksheet has the ratings of diseased cases. 
* The common vertical length is 20. 
* `ReaderID`: the reader labels: these must be from `1`, `2`, `3` or `4`, as declared in the `Truth` worksheet. 
* `ModalityID`: `4` or `2`, as declared in the `Truth` worksheet. 
* `CaseID`: `16`, `17`, `18`, `19`, or `20`, as declared in the `Truth` worksheet   
* `LL_Rating`: the ratings of diseased cases.
* The following shows that reader '1' interprets all abnormal cases in the first modality, while reader '3' interprets them in the second modality.

```{r}
x$ratings$LL[,1,1:5,1]
x$ratings$LL[,3,1:5,1]
```
