\arguments{
\item{seed}{The seed variable, default is 123; set to NULL for truly random seed}

\item{K1}{The number of non-diseased cases, default is 50}

\item{K2}{The number of diseased cases, default is 50}

\item{desiredNumBins}{The desired number of bins; default is 5}

\item{muX}{The CBM mu parameter in condition X}

\item{muY}{The CBM mu parameter in condition Y}

\item{alphaX}{The CBM alpha parameter in condition X}

\item{alphaY}{The CBM alpha parameter in condition Y}

\item{rhoNor}{The correlation of non-diseased case z-samples}

\item{rhoAbn2}{The correlation of diseased case z-samples, when disease is visible in both conditions}
}
\value{
The desired dataset suitable for testing FitCorCbm
}
\description{
Simulates single modality 2-reader binned ROC dataset, simulated according to the CORCBM model,
for the purpose of testing the fitting program \code{\link{FitCorCbm}}.
}
\details{
X and Y refer to the two arms of the pairing. \code{muX} and \code{alphaX} refer to the univariate CBM parameters
in condition X, \code{rhoNor} is the correlation of ratings of non-diseased cases and \code{rhoAbn2} is the correlation of ratings of
diseased cases when disease is visible in both conditions. The ROC data is bined to 5 bins in each condition.
See referenced publication.
