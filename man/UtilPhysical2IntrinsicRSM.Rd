\title{Convert from physical to intrinsic RSM parameters}
\usage{
UtilPhysical2IntrinsicRSM(mu, lambdaP, nuP)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{The mean of the Gaussian distribution for the ratings of latent LLs, 
i.e. continuous ratings of lesions that were found by the search mechanism 
~ N(\eqn{\mu},1). The corresponding distribution for the ratings of 
latent NLs is N(0,1)}

\item{lambdaP}{The Poisson \emph{physical} parameter, which describes the 
distribution of random numbers of latent NLs (suspicious regions that do
not correspond to actual lesions) per case; the mean of these random 
numbers asymptotically approaches lambdaP}

\item{nuP}{The \emph{physical} \eqn{\nu} parameter; it is the success probability
of the binomial distribution describing the random number of latent LLs 
(suspicious regions that correspond to actual lesions) per diseased case}
}
\value{
A list containing \eqn{\lambda} and \eqn{\nu}, the physical parameters
}
\description{
Convert \strong{physical} RSM parameters \eqn{\lambda}' and \eqn{\nu}' to the 
   \strong{intrinsic} RSM parameters \eqn{\lambda} and \eqn{\nu}. The physical 
   parameters are more meaningful but they depend on \eqn{\mu}. The intrinsic 
   parameters are independent of \eqn{\mu}. See book for details.
}
\details{
RSM is the Radiological Search Model described in the book. A latent mark 
   becomes an actual mark if the corresponding rating exceeds the lowest reporting 
   threshold zeta1. See also \code{\link{UtilIntrinsic2PhysicalRSM}}.
}
\examples{
mu <- 2;lambdaP <- 10;nuP <- 0.9
lambda <- UtilPhysical2IntrinsicRSM(mu, lambdaP, nuP)$lambda 
nu <- UtilPhysical2IntrinsicRSM(mu, lambdaP, nuP)$nu 
## note that the physical values are only constrained to be positive, e.g., nu is not constrained
## to be between 0 and one.
