\usage{
UtilIntrinsic2PhysicalRSM(mu, lambda, nu)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{The mean of the Gaussian distribution for the ratings of latent 
LLs, i.e. continuous ratings of lesions that were found by the search 
mechanism ~ N(\eqn{\mu},1). The corresponding distribution for the 
ratings of latent NLs is N(0,1).}

\item{lambda}{The Poisson \emph{intrinsic} parameter, related to \eqn{\lambda}', 
the latter is the mean of the Poisson distribution of numbers of latent NLs 
(suspicious regions that do not correspond to actual lesions) per case.}

\item{nu}{The \emph{intrinsic} \eqn{\nu} parameter; the corresponding 
\emph{physical} parameter is the success probability of the binomial 
distribution of random numbers of latent LLs (suspicious regions that 
correspond to actual lesions) per diseased case, i.e., the chance that 
a lesion is "found".}
}
\value{
A list containing \eqn{\lambda}' and \eqn{\nu}'
}
\description{
Convert \strong{intrinsic} RSM parameters \eqn{lambda} and \eqn{nu} 
   correspond to the \strong{physical} RSM parameters \eqn{lambda'} 
   and \eqn{nu'}. The physical parameters are more meaningful but they 
   depend on \eqn{mu}. The intrinsic parameters are independent of 
   \eqn{mu}. See book for details.
}
\details{
RSM is the Radiological Search Model described in the book. 
  A latent mark becomes an actual mark if the corresponding rating 
  exceeds the lowest reporting threshold \eqn{\zeta}1. See also
  \code{\link{UtilPhysical2IntrinsicRSM}}.

\examples{
mu <- 2;lambda <- 20;nu <- 1.1512925 
lambdaP <- UtilIntrinsic2PhysicalRSM(mu, lambda, nu)$lambdaP 
nuP <- UtilIntrinsic2PhysicalRSM(mu, lambda, nu)$nuP 
## note that the physical values are only constrained to be positive, but the physical variable nuP
## must obey 0 <= nuP <= 1
