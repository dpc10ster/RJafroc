\title{
  Artificial Intelligence Systems and Observer Performance
}
\description{
\code{RJafroc} analyzes the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems/algorithms characterized 
    by a \emph{search-and-report} strategy. Historically observer performance has dealt with measuring radiologists' 
    performances in search tasks, e.g., searching for lesions in medical images and reporting them, but the implicit 
    location information has been ignored. The methods here apply to \emph{any} task involving searching for 
    and reporting arbitrary targets in images. The implemented methods apply 
    to analyzing the absolute and relative performances of AI systems, comparing AI performance to a group of human 
    readers or optimizing the reporting threshold of an AI system. In addition to performing historical receiver operating 
    characteristic (ROC) analysis (localization information ignored), the software also performs free-response receiver operating
    characteristic (FROC) analysis, where the implicit lesion localization information is used. A book describing the 
    underlying methodology and which uses the software has been 
    published: \strong{Chakraborty DP: Observer Performance Methods for Diagnostic Imaging - Foundations, Modeling, and Applications 
    with R-Based Examples, Taylor-Francis LLC; 2017}: \url{https://www.routledge.com/Observer-Performance-Methods-for-Diagnostic-Imaging-Foundations-Modeling/Chakraborty/p/book/9781482214840}.
    Online updates to this book, which use the software, are at 
    \url{https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocQuickStart/}, \url{https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocRocBook/} and at 
    \url{https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocFrocBook/}. Supported data collection paradigms are the ROC, FROC and the location ROC (LROC). 
    ROC data consists of single ratings per images, where a rating is the perceived confidence level that the image is that of a 
    diseased patient. An ROC curve is a plot of true positive fraction vs. false 
    positive fraction. FROC data consists of a variable number (zero or more) of mark-rating pairs per image, where a mark is the 
    location of a reported suspicious region and the rating is the confidence level that it is a real lesion. LROC data 
    consists of a rating and a location of the most suspicious region, for every image. Four models of observer performance, 
    and curve-fitting software, are implemented: the binormal model (BM), the contaminated binormal model (CBM), the 
    correlated contaminated binormal model (CORCBM), and the radiological search model (RSM). Unlike the binormal model, CBM, 
    CORCBM and RSM predict "proper" ROC curves that do not inappropriately cross the chance diagonal. Additionally, RSM 
    parameters are related to search performance (not measured in conventional ROC analysis) and classification performance. 
    Search performance refers to finding lesions, i.e., true positives, while simultaneously not finding false positive 
    locations. Classification performance measures the ability to distinguish between true and false positive locations. Knowing 
    these separate performances allows principled optimization of reader or AI system performance. This package supersedes Windows 
    \strong{JAFROC} (jackknife alternative FROC) software V4.2.1, \url{https://github.com/dpc10ster/WindowsJafroc}. Package functions 
    are organized as follows. Data file related function names are preceded by \emph{Df}, curve fitting functions by \emph{Fit}, included 
    data sets by \emph{dataset}, plotting functions by \emph{Plot}, significance testing functions by \emph{St}, sample size related functions
    by \emph{Ss}, data simulation functions by \emph{Simulate} and utility functions by \emph{Util}. Implemented are figures of merit (FOMs) 
    for quantifying performance, functions for visualizing empirical operating characteristics: e.g., ROC, FROC, alternative FROC 
    (AFROC) and weighted AFROC (wAFROC) curves. For fully crossed study designs significance testing of reader-averaged FOM 
    differences between modalities is implemented via both Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz and the Obuchowski-Rockette methods. Also 
    implemented are single treatment analyses, allowing comparison of performance of a group of radiologists to a specified 
    value, or comparison of AI to a group of radiologists/algorithms interpreting the same cases. Crossed-modality analysis is implemented 
    wherein there are two crossed treatment factors and the aim is to determined performance in each treatment factor averaged 
    over all levels of the second factor. Sample size estimation tools are provided for ROC and FROC studies; these use estimates 
    of the relevant variances from a pilot study to predict required numbers of readers and cases in a pivotal study to achieve the
    desired power. Utility and data file manipulation functions allow data to be read in any of the currently used input
    formats, including Excel, and the results of the analysis can be viewed in text or Excel output files. The methods are
    illustrated with several included datasets from the author's collaborations. This update includes improvements to the code, 
    some as a result of user-reported bugs and new feature requests, and others discovered during ongoing testing and code simplification. 
    All changes are noted in \strong{NEWS.md}.

\section{Dataset}{
  The \code{dataset} object has 3 \code{list} elements: \code{$ratings}, \code{$lesions} 
     and \code{$descriptions}, where:
     
     \itemize{
     \item \code{dataset$ratings}: contains 3 elements as sub-lists: \code{$NL}, 
        \code{$LL} and \code{$LL_IL}; these describe the structure of the ratings;
        
     \item \code{dataset$lesions}: contains 3 elements as sub-lists: \code{$perCase}, 
        \code{$IDs} and \code{$weights}; these describe the structure of the lesions;
        
     \item \code{dataset$descriptions}: contains 7 elements as sub-lists: \code{$fileName}, 
        \code{$type}, \code{$name}, \code{$truthTableStr}, \code{$design}, \code{$modalityID} 
        and \code{$readerID}; these describe other characteristics of the dataset as 
        detailed next. 
    }
    
    \strong{Note: \code{-Inf} is used to indicate the ratings of unmarked lesions 
        and/or missing values.} As an example of the latter, if the maximum 
        number of NLs in a dataset is 4, but some images have fewer than 4 NL marks, 
        the corresponding "empty" positions would be filled with 
        \code{-Inf}s. \strong{Do not use \code{NA} to denote a missing rating.}
     
    \strong{Note}: \bold{"dataset" in this package always represents
    \code{R} object(s) with the following structure(s):}
    
    \subsection{General data structure, e.g., \code{dataset02}, an ROC dataset, and 
        \code{dataset05}, an FROC dataset.}{
    \itemize{
    \item \code{ratings$NL}: a float array with dimensions
        \code{c(I, J, K, maxNL)}, containing the ratings of NL marks. The first 
        \code{K1} locations of the third index corresponds to NL marks on non-diseased 
        cases and the remaining locations correspond to NL marks on diseased 
        cases. The 4th dimension allows for multiple NL marks 
        on a case: the first index holds the first NL rating on the image, 
        the second holds the second NL rating on the image, etc. The value of 
        \code{maxNL} is determined by the case with the maximum number of lesions 
        per case in the dataset. For \bold{FROC} datasets missing NL ratings are assigned the 
        \code{-Inf} rating. For \bold{ROC} datasets, FP ratings are assigned 
        to the first \code{K1} elements of \code{NL[,,1:K1,1]} and the remaining 
        \code{K2} elements of \code{NL[,,(K1+1):K,1]} are set to \code{-Inf}. 
             
    \item \code{ratings$LL}: for non-LROC datasets a float array with dimensions   
        \code{c(I, J, K2, maxLL)} containing the ratings of LL marks. The value of 
        \code{maxLL} is determined by the maximum number of lesions per case in the 
        dataset. Unmarked lesions are assigned the \code{-Inf} rating.
        For ROC datasets \code{TP} ratings are assigned to \code{LL[,,1:K2,1]}.
        For \bold{LROC} datasets it is a float array with dimensions  
        \code{c(I, J, K2, 1)} containing the ratings of correct localizations, 
        otherwise the rating is recorded in the incorrect localization array
        described next. 

    \item \code{ratings$LL_IL}: for LROC datasets the ratings
        of incorrect localization marks on abnormal cases. It is a float array 
        with dimensions \code{c(I, J, K2, 1)}. For non-LROC datasets this array 
        is filled with NAs.
             
    \item \code{lesions$perCase}: an integer array with length \code{K2}, 
        the number of lesions on each diseased case. The 
        maximum value of this array equals \code{maxLL}. For example,  
        \code{dataset05$lesions$perCase[4} is 2, meaning the 
        4th diseased case has two lesions.
             
    \item \code{lesions$IDs}: an integer array with dimensions [\code{K2}, \code{maxLL}], 
        labeling (or naming) the lesions on the diseased cases. For example,  
        \code{dataset05$lesions$IDs[4,]} is \code{c(1,2,-Inf)}, meaning the 
        4th diseased case has two lesions, labeled 1 and 2. 

    \item \code{lesions$weights}: a floating point array with dimensions 
        \code{c(K2, maxLL)}, representing the relative importance of detecting 
        each lesion. The weights for an abnormal case must sum to unity. 
        For example, \code{dataset05$lesions$weights[4,]} is \code{c(0.5,0.5, -Inf)}, 
        corresponding to equal weights (0.5) assigned to of the two lesions in the
        case.
             
    \item \code{descriptions$fileName}: a \code{character} variable containing the file
        name of the source data for this dataset. This is generated automatically
        by the \link{DfReadDataFile} function used to read the file. For a simulalated
        dataset it is set to "NA" (i.e., a character vector, not the variable \code{NA}). 
    
    \item \code{descriptions$type}: a \code{character} variable describing the data type: 
        "\code{ROC}", "\code{LROC}", "\code{ROI}" or "\code{FROC}".
    
    \item \code{descriptions$name}: a \code{character} variable containing the name of 
        the dataset: e.g., "dataset02" or "dataset05". This is generated automatically
        by the \link{DfReadDataFile} function used to read the file.
    
    \item \code{descriptions$truthTableStr}: a \code{c(I, J, L, maxLL+1)} object. For
        normal cases elements \code{c(I, J, L, 1)} are filled with 1s if the corresponding 
        interpretations occurred or NAs otherwise. For abnormal cases elements
        \code{c(I, J, L, 2:(maxLL+1))} are filled with 1s if the corresponding 
        interpretations occurred or NAs otherwise. This object is necessary for analyzing
        more complex designs, e.g., split-plot, as described next.

    \item \code{descriptions$design}: a \code{character} variable: "\code{FCTRL}", 
        "\code{SPLIT-PLOT-A}" or "\code{SPLIT-PLOT-A}", corresponding to factorial,
        split-plot-A or split-plot-C designs. The A and C refer to subparts of Table VII
        in a Hillis 2014 publication.
    
    \item \code{descriptions$modalityID}: a \code{character} vector of length \eqn{I}, 
        which labels/names the modalities in the dataset. For non-JAFROC data file formats,
        they must be unique integers.
             
    \item \code{descriptions$readerID}: a \code{character} vector of length \eqn{J}, 
        which labels/names the readers in the dataset. For non-JAFROC data file formats,
        they must be unique integers.

    \item \code{ratings$LL}: a float array with dimensions
