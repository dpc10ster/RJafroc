title: "CRAN comments"
---


# Reason for submission TBA
* In response to an email from Deepayan Sarkar <deepayan.sarkar@r-project.org> and Kurt Hornik <Kurt.Hornik@wu.ac.at> requesting an update to the current CRAN version 2.1.0 of `RJafroc` which is generating 3 NOTES, one of which is file-size related (installed size is 5.2Mb on `r-oldrel-windows-ix86+x86 64`). 
* Specifically, they requested a fix to the 2 NOTES relating to the "Found the following math rendering problems" NOTEs in the "HTML version of manual" on the `r-devel-linux-x86 64 debian-clang` and the `r-devel-linux-x86 64-debian-gcc` platforms. 
* This update (v2.1.1) should fix these two NOTES.

| R Version    | Platform                    | Status |
|:-------------|:----------------------------|:-------|
| R-devel      | x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit) | OK     |
| R release    | x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit) | OK     |
| R-oldrelease | x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit) | NOTE\*     |

`*` Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION, all of which are false positives.


## CRAN compatibility

CRAN compatibility was tested using `rhub::check_for_cran()`. The last three messages were generated by the previous version. The first one is new.

| Platform                                 | Status                                     |
|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran   | NOTE\*\*\*\*                                         |
| Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release, GCC | NOTE\*\*\* (file size is 5.8Mb, see below) |
| Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC ASAN/UBSAN    | PREPERROR\* (see below)                    |
| Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64 bit     | NOTE\*\* (see below)                       |

`****` NOTE Skipping checking HTML validation: no command 'tidy' found. I am not using `tidy` and have not turned on HTML validation.

`***` I would have to remove a significant number of code, tests and datasets to meet the strict 5MB requirement on this platform. 

`*` PREPERROR: dependency ‘openxlsx’ not available; it appears one of the packages that my package depends on is not available on this platform.

`**` checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE Found the following files/directories: 'lastMiKTeXException'. There is no such file/directory on my computer. This might be some issue with `LaTeX` that I cannot reproduce, [as others have observed](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503). 


## Summary of checks in other `rhub`implemented environments

* These were selected based on the two NOTES generated by the earlier submission.
